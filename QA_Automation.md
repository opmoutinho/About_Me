# QA_AUTOMATION TEST

## As a QA Automation Tester Iâ€™ve been working with: Selenium, Java 8, Jenkins, Qlik, Git, Maven, Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, Cucumber, AWS.
### The solution had 2 sides, the Data Quality and Availability, and the Features/Visualizations. 
#### To test the data:
It was developed an Automated solution that compared the data values throughout the Application Release and Development Cycle. This was achieved with AWS SDK (to automatically query the Database), API requests to retrieve Data Information from a FE Solution and Selenium with Java to retrieve info from FE Qlik Solution. This way the Data Quality, and Availability was being tested on a daily basis ensuring the quality of the CI/CD process.
#### To test the FE:
I used Selenium, and xPath to ensure the presence and functionality of the desired elements. Being able to replicate the human behaviour as precise as possible, and even go further than a human would go while utilizing the application.
